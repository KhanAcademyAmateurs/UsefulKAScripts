# Useful KA Scripts

Collection of a lot of useful scripts for automating stuff for you.
Currently includes:
* next-eval.scpt: An OSAScript (AppleScript) for quickly (and legitimately) evaluating projects.
  * It opens a few projects to evaluate.
  * Once you've finished evaluating a project, it quits the tab.
  * Once you've finished evaluating all the projects, it generates a new set.
  * Completely legitimate. These are real projects, with real creators, & with real consequences.
  * Run by Terminal.app (`git clone https://github.com/KhanAcademyAmateurs/UsefulKAScripts; osascript UsefulKAScripts/next-eval.scpt`) or by Script Editor.
